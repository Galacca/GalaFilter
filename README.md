# GalaFilter
Path of Exile 2 - endgame lootfilter

If you somehow stumbled upon this outside my friend circle this is an ENDGAME lootfilter.

It hides all uncut support gems and ALL mace basetypes that are not rare.
It hides all non-expert bases that are normal or magic
It hides all non-unique flasks that do not have quality.

Version 0.2.1

Fixed normal/magic maces being visible.
Added a safety rarity check for flasks. Probably redundant.
