# GalaFilter
Path of Exile 2 - endgame lootfilter
Based off of Neversinks 0.1.1

If you somehow stumbled upon this outside my friend circle this is an ENDGAME lootfilter.

Hides all uncut support gems.
Hides all mace basetypes that are not rare.
Hides all non-expert bases that are normal or magic.
Hides all non-unique flasks that do not have quality.

Highlights high value uniques.
Highlights uniques bases with multiple uniques conservatively.
Highlights greater essences
Highlights high value distills.
Highlights all cores.

Attempts to have a consistant color theme.
Attempts to have minimal minimap clutter.

Version 0.2.2

Moved silk robe to bait bases.
Fixed bug with all rings being counted as high value.

Version 0.2.1

Fixed normal/magic maces being visible.
Added a safety rarity check for flasks. Probably redundant.
